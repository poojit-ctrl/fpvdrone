## 🛠️ Dev Logs

### Log 1 — July 3 — 3 hours  
Kicked things off with a rough sketch of one drone arm. Kinda freestyled it at first just to get the proportions right. It’s giving low poly energy but it’s fine for now. Started defining anchor points, main circles, and a flat reference. Just wanted to see something on screen ngl. Didn’t go too deep. Mostly just sketch and vibe.

### Log 2 — July 4 — 3 hours  
Went full nerd and started dimensioning everything. Dialed in the hole placements to ±0.01 mm. The arm got some realistic mounting holes too. I used the "Fix" constraint like a cheat code. The goal was making one arm perfect so I can mirror it later. Honestly, this part was surprisingly fun.

### Log 3 — July 5 — 3 hours  
Time to go symmetric. Mirrored that one finished arm into four. Boom—X-frame instantly. Seeing it all align felt good. I tweaked a bit to keep everything smooth and centered. Even added mid-line constraints to avoid future chaos. Very chill but satisfying work session.

### Log 4 — July 6 — 3 hours  
Today was clean-up and contour day. I cut a neat circular slot in the center and shaved off weird edges. Played around with how the arms curve into the center plate. Tried to keep it modular so one break doesn’t destroy the whole thing. Saving this design now felt way more solid.

### Log 5 — July 7 — 3 hours  
Started working on the outer arm tips. Calculated exact motor mount spacing and added dual-hole patterns. Had to rotate the mounts by 45° because that’s what’s trending and functional. Checked the hole sizes twice. Shoutout to @toby from Slack for suggesting motor specs and pre-reviewing this part.

### Log 6 — July 8 — 3 hours  
Assembled the center + arm units for the first time. Arms looked sharp. Made sure each arm was removable. Spaced things out so M3 screws could fit in nicely. I think we’re officially in the “it looks like a drone” phase. Had to fix a few weird shell merge issues too.

### Log 7 — July 9 — 3 hours  
The overlapping bits between arm and mid-plate were bugging me. So I made a clean cut that fits like a socket. No glue or junky fits needed. Played with clearance values too. Hoping this makes disassembly a breeze in the field. Bonus points for modularity.

### Log 8 — July 10 — 3 hours  
Revisited motor mount designs after checking motor specs again. Standardized everything around a 23mm M2 bolt pattern. Realized I forgot to offset the motor cable exits—fixed that too. Pretty confident the frame arms are done unless someone finds a flaw.

### Log 9 — July 11 — 3 hours  
Stacked in the standoffs to complete the sandwich design. The frame started to look like it came off a store shelf. Gave it more volume, added screw holes to lock the standoffs into the plates. No flex no wobble. Can’t wait to slap components on it once it's printed.

### Log 10 — July 13 — 3 hours  
Final render. Final sanity checks. Did a full dry run of what components will go where. Sent over screenshots to friends for peer feedback. Thinking of getting it CNC’d instead of 3D printing now. Frame’s 100% ready for slicing but still waiting on project grant approval.
